# Experiment Description

The experiment aims to measure the effect of Cu2+ on the growth of plants. For this purpose, a sample of garden cress seeds were planted in petri dishes infused with different concentrations of **CuSO4.5H2O**. The concentrations were **3.125mg/l, 6.25mg/l, 12.5mg/l, 25mg/l, 50mg/l and 100mg/l**, **three** petri dishes for each concentration with **22-25** seeds planted in each petri dish. A control sample of 3 petri dishes with 22-25 seeds infused with distilled water was also planted.

After a week, each petri dish was taken out and all the seeds were measured by root length in mm, stem length in mm and the sum of both was calculated also in mm. It was also noted which ones had branched roots as this is also supposed to be an indicator for the presence of a toxicant.

Experiment was held as a practical class part of the Ecological monitoring discipline at Faculty of Biology, Sofia University.

## Task #1 and #2

Calculate mean and standard deviation of the control sample and each concentration. Calculate the percentage of inhibition - if the control sample has a mean of X and the current sample has a mean of Y, then the growth percent compared to the control would be (Y/X)\*100 and the inhibition percent would be 100 - (Y/X)\*100.

## Task #3, #4 and #5

Plot the inhibition percentage as a function of the concentration. Create a linear model approximation and get the coefficients. Use the coefficients to calculate the concentration needed to cause a 50% growth inhibition.

```{r}
x = c(3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100)
y_root = c(root_limit_3.125mg, root_limit_6.25mg, root_limit_12.5mg, root_limit_25mg, root_limit_50mg, root_limit_100mg)
y_stem = c(stem_limit_3.125mg, stem_limit_6.25mg, stem_limit_12.5mg, stem_limit_25mg, stem_limit_50mg, stem_limit_100mg)
y_sum = c(sum_limit_3.125mg, sum_limit_6.25mg, sum_limit_12.5mg, sum_limit_25mg, sum_limit_50mg, sum_limit_100mg)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
df_root = data.frame(x,y_root)
ggplot(df_root, aes(x=factor(x), y=y_root, group=1)) + geom_line(color='brown') + geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=y_root)) + geom_smooth(method='lm') + ggtitle('Inhibition percentage for root') + ylab('Inhibition percentage') + xlab('Concentration of Cu2+ in mg/l')
model_root = lm(y_root ~ x, data = df_root)
model_root
b0_root = summary(model_root)$coefficients[1,1]
b1_root = summary(model_root)$coefficients[2,1]
ec50_root = (50 - b0_root)/b1_root
ec50_root
```

```{r}
df_stem = data.frame(x,y_stem)
ggplot(df_stem, aes(x=factor(x), y=y_stem, group=1)) + geom_line(color='darkgreen') + geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=y_stem)) + stat_smooth(method='lm') + ggtitle('Inhibition percentage for stem') + ylab('Inhibition percentage') + xlab('Concentration of Cu2+ in mg/l')
model_stem = lm(y_stem ~ x, data = df_stem)
model_stem
b0_stem = summary(model_stem)$coefficients[1,1]
b1_stem = summary(model_stem)$coefficients[2,1]
ec50_stem = (50 - b0_stem)/b1_stem
ec50_stem
```

```{r}
df_sum = data.frame(x,y_sum)
ggplot(df_sum, aes(x=factor(x), y=y_sum, group=1)) + geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=y_sum)) + stat_smooth(method='lm') + ggtitle('Inhibition percentage for root + stem') + ylab('Inhibition percentage') + xlab('Concentration of Cu2+ in mg/l')
model_sum = lm(y_sum ~ x, data = df_sum)
model_sum
b0_sum = summary(model_sum)$coefficients[1,1]
b1_sum = summary(model_sum)$coefficients[2,1]
ec50_sum = (50 - b0_sum)/b1_sum
ec50_sum
```

## Task #6 and #7

Compare the concentration values causing a 50% inhibition in the root, stem and overall. Conclude which part of the plant is most susceptible to the toxicant.

```{r}
ec50 = c(ec50_root,ec50_stem,ec50_sum)
names = c("root", "stem", "sum")
df_ec50 = data.frame(names, ec50)
df_ec50
```

In this case we need the lowest concentration able to create a 50% growth inhibition. The table shows this is the value associated with the root - i.e. the root is most susceptible to the toxicant.

## Bonus

Plot the number of branched roots for each concentration.

```{r}
branched = c(sum(conc_3.125mg$root_branching), sum(conc_6.25mg$root_branching), sum(conc_12.5mg$root_branching), sum(conc_25mg$root_branching), sum(conc_50mg$root_branching), sum(conc_100mg$root_branching))
df_branched = data.frame(x, branched)
ggplot(df_branched, aes(x=factor(x), y=branched, group=1)) + geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=branched), vjust = -0.5) + ggtitle('Branching for each concentration') + ylab('Number of branched roots') + xlab('Concentration of Cu2+ in mg/l')
```
